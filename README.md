# What is YATT?

YATT is an integration hub for everything related to software quality.  We aim to make it easy for everyone to keep track of their software testing and quality efforts by providing accessible dashboards and metrics-driven insights into the Software Quality Lifecycle.

We believe that from development to production, one should never lose focus on software quality and the measures they take to ensure it. Likewise, the measures projects take to ensure quality shouldn't be a secret, but should be shared openly with others who depend on their work.&#x20;
